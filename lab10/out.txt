Jennifer: "What do you want for dinner?"
She looked at Jack from the kitchen.
Jack: "How about some spaghetti?"
He put down the newspaper, and looked at his fiancee.
Jennifer: "Nice try. We have run out of cheese."
Jack: "I'll get some at the market later; Do you want anything else?"
Jennifer said nothing.
Jack: "So, just cheese, right?"
Jennifer: "Yeah, I'm always right."
